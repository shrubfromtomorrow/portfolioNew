                    So, now knowing what it was I was going to do to try and
                    solve this issue, I needed to complete a second phase of
                    research where I pull pieces of information together on how
                    to create my calculator. The first thing I would need would
                    be software. Even if the calculator never got made
                    physically, knowing that there was some software that could
                    be put into any hardware would be a success to me.
                    <br /><br />
                    I quickly decided to use a JavaScript framwork called
                    Electron. Anyone who has written a desktop application will
                    groan at seeing that. Electron effectively allows me to
                    create a website that runs locally. This is great for a few
                    reasons, the largest of which is that I know how to create
                    the content, scripts, and most importantly, the styling. I
                    say styling is the most important because I knew I was going
                    to create a proof of concept, not a full product and how it
                    looks will be the thing most people will notice. The main
                    disadvantage of Electron is that it is terrible in the
                    performance department as it is basically a web browser. It
                    is also really easy to make an app in it and people that
                    have worked with one standard for a long time get really
                    angry when something easier becomes popular.<br /><br />
                    The next thing I would need is hardware. A screen, computer
                    of some kind, keyboard, and a case. The computer department
                    was an easy choice for me, I was using raspberry pis
                    extensively during the time of the inception of this project
                    and their familiarity drew me. I had also made many
                    mechanical keyboards before and while it was honestly a
                    silly pipe dream to fit a mechanical keyboard in a
                    calculator, it did work out in the end. Case would be easy,
                    I had access to 3D printers and could create prototypes in
                    CAD quite easily. And lastly the screen, it appears someone
                    has made a

                    just for this purpose that slots directly into the gpio pins
                    of my raspberry pi and has a convenient hdmi "flipper".<br /><br />So
                    how would I load my software? Well, in the beginning, I
                    thought I would modify the Linux kernel a little bit so that
                    when it booted, I would boot directly into my program. Later
                    in this process I realized that this was an idiotic idea for
                    a proof of concept as it would take far too much time and it
                    wouldn't really get noticed in such an initial product.
                    <br />Another idea I had was to create my own circuit board.
                    After a raspberry pi prototype, it seemed obvious that the
                    next move would be to create my own circuit board that was
                    tailored to what I needed. I knew early on that a raspberry
                    pi would be too much for what I needed to do. I know now
                    that the next step is to use a microprocessor that is
                    designed for one purpose, then to move to my own board.<br /><br />
                    There were a few things that I wanted to keep in mind for my
                    software design. The first was responsive math input. If you
                    want to type a fraction, you type "2/3" and it shows up as
                    such. I wanted a situation where when people type the divide
                    symbol, the next number is inputted under the previous
                    number with a line between them. The notation that shows
                    "2/3" is called infix notation and I wanted it to be
                    displayed as what I will call readable notation. I also
                    wanted to have responsive graph input, meaning that as you
                    input more and more to your function, the function is
                    evaluated with each keystroke and if it is valid, it is
                    graphed.<br />
                    Basically, I wanted to copy a few of the features of Desmos.
                    In terms of the regular calculator, TI has that interface
                    pretty much figured out and I would be na√Øve to not take
                    inspiration.

                    And so now came the time of developing. All of the code and

                    than exactly the one that Desmos uses? I use a library

                    I will be picking my code apart on the next page and talking
                    about the challenges I faced and so if that is not
                    particularly interesting to you, I recommend finishing this
                    and moving on to the hardware page. I want to point out that
                    you can see responsive math input, a total of 6 functions
                    inputs, constants like pi and e, as well as trig functions
                    all present in the final product.

                    My github also contains a windows executable file in
                    exec/x64. It is important that the entire folder (x64) be
                    copied so that the dependencies are present when running the
                    setup executable.
