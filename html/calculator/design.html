                    So, now knowing what it was I was going to do to try and
                    solve this issue, I needed to complete a second phase of
                    research where I pull pieces of information together on how
                    to create my calculator. The first thing I would need would
                    be software. Even if the calculator never got made
                    physically, knowing that there was some software that could
                    be put into any hardware would be a success to me.
                    <br /><br />
                    I quickly decided to use a JavaScript framwork called
                    Electron. Anyone who has written an application will groan
                    at seeing that. Electron allows me to effectively create a
                    website that runs locally. This is great for a few reasons,
                    the largest of which is that I know how to create the
                    content, scripts, and most importantly, the styling. I say
                    styling is the most important because I knew I was going to
                    create a proof of concept, not a full product and how it
                    looks will be the thing most people will notice. The main
                    disadvantage of Electron is that it is terrible in the
                    performance department as it is basically a web browser. It
                    is also really easy to make an app in it and people that
                    have worked with one standard for a long time get really
                    angry when something easier becomes popular.<br /><br />
                    The next thing I would need is hardware. A screen, computer
                    of some kind, keyboard, and a case. The computer department
                    was an easy choice for me, I was using raspberry pis
                    extensively during the time of the inception of this project
                    and their familiarity drew me. I had also made many
                    mechanical keyboards before and while it was honestly a
                    silly pipe dream to fit a mechanical keyboard in a
                    calculator, it did work out in the end. Case would be easy,
                    I had access to 3D printers and could create prototypes in
                    CAD quite easily. And lastly the screen, it appears someone
                    has made a
                    <a

                    just for this purpose that slots directly into the gpio pins
                    of my raspberry pi and has a convenient hdmi "flipper".<br /><br />So
                    how would I load my software? Well, in the beginning, I
                    thought I would modify the Linux kernel a little bit so that
                    when it booted, I would boot directly into my program. Later
                    in this process i realized that this was an idiotic idea for
                    a proof of concept as it would take far too much time and it
                    wouldn't really get noticed in such an initial product. <br/>Another idea I had was to create my own
