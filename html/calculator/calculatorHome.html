                    <br /><br />
                    I found myself in October of 2021, frustrated with the price
                    of a graphing calculator. I needed to buy a graphing
                    calculator for my upcoming ACT and I wanted to get a decent
                    one. I found the average cost for a calculator with a decent
                    resolution for graphing and a color display was around
                    $110.<br /><br />
                    I found myself outraged, and even more so after I got my TI
                    84 Plus CE and found it to be slow and clunky. Buying a
                    graphing calculator is limited. There are only a few
                    reputable brands with only a few halfway decent models worth
                    buying. Ignoring the sponsored links, the results on Amazon
                    for "graphing calculator" consist of 8 Texas Instruments
                    devices and one Casio (at the time of writing).<br /><br />
                    With whole tablets costing $50 dollars to manufacture,
                    surely there is a way to create a calculator that cost very
                    little, is far more powerful than other brands, and is
                    usable on standardized tests.
                    <br />Right?

                    Any good in-depth project has got to start with some
                    research. I started having a look around for root causes in
                    the price of graphing calculators (keep in mind that I
                    didn't know how I wanted to tackle this issue at first).<br /><br />
                    The first main article I looked at was made by the

                    if you want to remove the paywall ;)<br />
                    This article might be old, but it is still relevent. It
                    highlights the massive strides that have been made in
                    technology in the two decades previous and how graphing
                    calculators do not reflect that same leap in technology.<br /><br />
                    The article also talks about how Texas Instruments had (as
                    of 2014) accounted for 93% of all graphing calculator sales,
                    Casio taking the other seven percent up to a useful
                    precision. <br /><br />By far the most important thing to
                    take away from this article is this line: "<strong
                        >“Compared to other electronics this day and age there
                        is very little content,”</strong
                    >
                    said Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis of the TI-84 Plus.
                    <strong
                        >“Plastic case, small black and white screen, two
                        semiconductor chips. The batteries are even not
                        rechargeable like a cell phone.”</strong
                    >
                    He estimates a TI-84 Plus costs <strong>$15-20</strong> to
                    manufacture and has a profit margin of over
                    <strong>50</strong> percent for Texas Instruments."<br /><br />
                    This article goes much further in depth than I wish to here
                    and I recommend reading it to gain an idea of the
                    frustration I feel over this topic.<br /><br />
                    Another increadibly important article for my research is
                    <a
                        target="_blank"
                        rel="noreferrer noopener"
                        href="https://thehustle.co/graphing-calculators-expensive"
                        >this</a
                    >
                    one by the Hustle. It talks about how TI in particular
                    cornered the graphing calculator market through agressive
                    lobbying that made it so their calculators would effectively
                    be required in certain classrooms and tests.<br /><br />
                    These articles and others taught me a fair bit about what
                    was going on with the price of calculators. They also told
                    me what my market should be if I was going to try to solve
                    this problem: classrooms and tests where academic integrity
                    is of the highest standard.

                    Now having an idea of the problem I was trying to solve, the
                    next step was to have a look around for solutions that
                    already exist.
                    <a
                        target="_blank"
                        rel="noreferrer noopener"
                        href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator"
                        >Desmos</a
                    >
                    (free) was the first thing that came to mind. As a high
                    school student who enjoys math, an online graphing
                    calculator is an amazing resource, and Desmos executes this
                    perfectly. The only issue with it is that it is only useable
                    on a traditional browser, something that would never be let
                    near an official testing facility. There is a lot to learn
                    from Desmos though so keep the name in your mind.<br /><br />
                    Another solution is the brand Catiga. They pop up everywhere
                    when you make a quick search for a cheap graphing calculator
                    with their most popular seller on Amazon being $40 USD. This
                    is great, especially when considering that it has similar
                    functionality to the TI-83 Plus, which is $86 USD. Still, I
                    think that there can be improvements. $40 USD seems too much
                    for too little even though it is a large stride beyond TI's
                    equivalent. First off, it is a colorless LCD display at an
                    incredibly low resolution and while the screen size is
                    relatively big (3 inch diagonal), it doesn't matter too much
                    if you can't show enough detail. Though I don't have it in
                    my hand, it does seem that this calculator has a lot going
                    for it on the feature front though.<br /><br />
                    It was around this time, realizing that there wasn't really
                    a great alternative graphing calcualtor for the testing
                    environment, that I caved to the idea that had been itching
                    me for a while: making my own calculator.
