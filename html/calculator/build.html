                    In this guide I will lay out the general steps for
                    assembling the first prototype of my calculator on your own.
                    First, a list of materials.<br /><br />
                    <ul>
                        <li>Raspberry Pi 3b with a micro SD card for an OS</li>
                        <li>This screen</li>
                        <li>These keyswitches</li>
                        <li>These keycaps</li>
                        <li>
                            Some 16 guage copper wire. Maybe 4 ft to be safe.
                        </li>
                        <li>Some diodes. These work well.</li>
                        <li>Electrical tape.</li>
                        <li>My github</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    You will also need access to at least a 3D printer. A laser
                    cutter will make dealing with the switchplate a lot easier,
                    but it isn't necessary. <br />
                    Those of you who may have read the narrative section of This
                    calculator will notice that most of these items are
                    specifically for the keyboard; it is the item that will take
                    the most time, effort, and resources to construct.<br />
                    On the software side of things, you will need the link to my
                    github above as it contains the executable you will need to
                    run this calculator. <br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="header scroll">Setting up the Pi</div>
                <div class="content scroll">
                    The first thing you will need to do it flash your Raspberry
                    Pi. There are instructions all over the internet and so I
                    will leave you to figure it out. However, AND THIS IS
                    IMPERATIVE, YOU MUST SELECT THE 64 BIT VERSION OF RASPBERRY
                    PI OS. The executable will not run on the 32 bit that is
                    standard. You can select 64 bit under the "Raspberry Pi OS
                    (other)" tab, you are just looking for the regular 64 bit
                    version.<br />
                    Once you have the micro SD card flashed, plug it into your
                    Pi, power the Pi, and connect up a display and keyboard.
                    Once you are in the desktop, you will need to get the Pi's
                    IP address.

                        >This</a
                    >
                    guide provides good guidance. You needn't SSH into the Pi
                    yet, just make sure you have the IP address.<br />
                    Now you need to get the executable that holds the
                    calculator. On your desktop, using my github link, navigate
                    to the "execs/arm64/" directory. Inside you should see
                    "calcapp_1.0.0_arm64.deb". Click on the .deb file and click
                    download.<br />
                    From here you will need to copy this over to the Raspberry
                    Pi. There are several ways to do this. To get around having
                    to copy it entirely, you could download it from the Pi's
                    browser. Another option would be a USB stick. You could also
                    use SSH to copy it over. There are many guides online so I
                    won't cover it here. <br />
                    Once you have the .deb file on your Raspberry Pi, you will
                    need to install it. From the terminal, navigate to the
                    directory that has the .deb file. To install it, type "sudo
                    apt install calcapp_1.0.0_arm64.deb". This will install the
                    .deb as an application you can run anywhere on the Raspberry
                    Pi by typing "calcapp". However, we want to take this a step
                    further. First, the resolution of the Pi needs to be lowered
                    so as to fit the screen and second, we want this calcapp to
                    autoexecute on boot. To do this, we first need to create a
                    shell script that will run two commands. From the home
                    directory of the Pi, type "nano exec.sh". Once inside nano,
                    add two lines of text: "xrandr -s 720x480" and "calcapp".
                    Save changes and exit nano. Now, type "chmod +x exec.sh"
                    into the terminal to make the script executable. "xrandr -s
                    720x480" will set the resolution outputted by the Pi to
                    720x480 which, while larger than the screen, is the 3:2
                    aspect ratio, this helps to reduce blurring as 480x320 is
                    not an option. <br />
                    That script we just created is only one part of having the
                    calculator and resolution change automatically. Now we need
                    to actually make it autoexecute. From the home directory in
                    the terminal, type "cd .config" to enter into the .config
                    directory. From here, type "mkdir autostart", this will
                    create a new directory in .config that Raspberry Pi looks
                    for when booting up. Change into autostart with "cd
                    autostart/". Raspberry Pi looks for a special kind of file
                    to execute named with a ".desktop" extension. Thus, we need
                    to create a file called exec.desktop. Type "nano
                    exec.desktop" to create a .desktop file and begin editing
                    it. In the file, type:
                </div>
                <div class="content scroll">
                    <pre><code class="language-js">[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Calc
Exec=/home/{username}/exec.sh</code></pre>
                </div>
                <div class="content scroll">
                    ({username} should be the username of your Raspberry Pi).
                    Exit out of nano with ctrl+x and pressing y to save changes.
                    This file creates a new desktop entry that executes the
                    script in the Raspberry Pi's home directory. <br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="content scroll">
                    With that, you are done. By rebooting the Raspberry Pi, you
                    should see it boot right into the calculator app. Now that
                    the Pi is set up, we can move onto the keyboard and the case.
