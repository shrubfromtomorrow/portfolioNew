                    The design of the hardware for my calculator.

                    Hardware was the area where I had the most iterations of
                    various parts of my calculator. This is where I designed the
                    case, keyboard, and the display and compute unit
                    configuration. Most of this is about the keyboard as it took
                    the longest, the other aspects of the design were really
                    just rote iteration.<br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="content scroll">
                    The hardware design began when a screen I ordered on Amazon
                    arrived and I could begin to test how it fit with my
                    Raspberry Pi. It fit perfectly on top (as it should) and
                    even came with a heatsink for the CPU of the Raspberry Pi
                    and an active fan for cooling over the rest of the board,
                    more than I needed but a nice touch nonetheless. The screen
                    had a 3.5 inch diagonal and a 480x320 resolution, more than
                    necessary but again, a nice touch. The biggest issue that I
                    could see right away was the thickness. The screen stacked
                    on top of the already bulky Raspberry Pi lead to a thickness
                    of 22mm. That doesn't sound like a lot but it is not
                    comfortable to hold in your hand and bothered me from the
                    start.<br />
                    Raspberry Pi started the screen in 1920x1080 for some reason
                    and so (while it was nearly illegible) I went to change the
                    resolution settings. 480x320 is not widely supported and so
                    I did not find it as possible display output mode on the
                    Raspberry Pi, a small setback but I could work through it.
                    In general 3:2 aspect ratios are not commonly supported but
                    there was a 720x480 resolution that I could use. I wanted to
                    use a display output that maintains the same aspect ratio as
                    the display so as to reduce blurriness.<br />
                    The next time that I rebooted the Raspberry Pi, the display
                    settings didn't stick. I thought it might have been a
                    configuration issue and so I tried again to no avail.
                    <br /><br />

                <div class="content scroll">
                    This was when I started to get frustrated. I then decided to
                    go outside of the configuration menu that Raspberry Pi OS
                    gives you and I went to change the properties I wanted to
                    change through the command line. Raspbian (Raspberry Pi OS)
                    is a Linux distribution and so I knew that I would be able
                    to change display properties through a common command called
                    xrandr. I don't want to get into display managers and
                    general Linux-y stuff here becuase this isn't the sort of
                    project for it but I wanted to mention how I could change
                    the resolution.<br />
                    Of course, this also didn't stick. Now I was pretty mad. I
                    knew that somewhere there was a configuratino file that was
                    overwriting my changes on boot but I couldn't figure it out.
                    I then went looking for an autoexec file. These are files
                    that have commands that get executed when different parts of
                    the OS come into use. In Linux, there are a lot. bash.rc,
                    the init.d directory, and rc.local are the main ones are
                    Raspbian. I put my commands in a bash.rc and then they
                    worked on boot, hooray.<br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="content scroll">
                    Now I could get to putting my code onto the Rasberry Pi.
                    This was actually incredibly easy, I just made an SSH
                    connection with the Raspberry Pi and used a command called
                    rsync to copy the code over.<br />
                    There was an issue though. The source code would work fine
                    on the Raspberru Pi, but there were a lot of different
                    configurations in Electron that would not work on the
                    Raspberry Pi. The foremost of these is that the Raspberry Pi
                    CPU architecture is ARM, not the x86 architechture that I
                    was developing for on my laptop. In conjunction with this,
                    the Raspberry Pi didn't even have Electron installed, or
                    even Node (the framework that runs Electron). This was
                    itself a debacle to fix but it was really just about
                    executing the right commands, so I won't talk about it here.
                    Now with Electron and Node installed, I was able to run
                    commands to build my software for ARM. I got my executable
                    and it ran perfectly the first time. There's no joke, it
                    actually just worked.<br/><br/>
