                    So hopefully you are reading this after having had a look at
                    the rest of the timeline though I wouldn't blame you if you
                    skipped it, it takes a while to read. I wanted to, at the
                    end of all of this, reassert what I am trying to do here.
                    The end goal is to have students that need to take the SAT
                    or the ACT (or any other standardized test for that matter)
                    look on Amazon or in Best Buy and right next to the $150
                    graphing calculators, see a $50 dollar option with as many
                    necessary features and good reviews as all of the big
                    brands. It's a tough task, but even as I head into the next
                    stage of my life with university, it's a challenge I am
                    going to continue to pursue, all because a calculator cost
                    too much. <br /><br />

                    There are a few things that I want to mention regarding the
                    future, some are core aspects of the project, some are just
                    in regards to the physical design of the calculator.<br />
                    The first thing I want to talk about is the next stage of
                    prototyping. <br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="content scroll">
                    The single biggest drawback to my previous prototype is my
                    choice of compute unit. Using a Raspberry Pi is
                    fundamentally against the vision of this project as it is an
                    incredibly open piece of hardware. Not only does it hold a
                    full OS that bad actors could get into, the whole point of
                    something like a Raspberry Pi is that you have control over
                    your hardware, something that would not lend to approval for
                    use in schools and testing environments. Here we get the
                    stage of the project that I am currently working on.<br />
                    In late February (2023) I met with Dan Rosenstein whose
                    current title is "Group Product Manager - Advanced Autonomy
                    and Applied Robotics at Microsoft". He has an incredible
                    amount of experience with embedded systems and would be a
                    great help with the next stage of this project. During our
                    meeting we talked about the long term goals of the project
                    and the general pathway to turning something like this into
                    a product. One of the ideas I took away from the
                    conversation was the suggestion to create a prototype of the
                    calculator with an Arduino. Arduinos are an MCU
                    (microcontroller rather than the MPU that a Raspberry Pi is
                    (microprocessor)) and do not have an operating system built
                    in, they run firmware directly through a bootloader. This
                    would be fantastic in terms of locking down what the
                    calculator could possibly do: as long as people cannot
                    upload their own firmware to the Arduino, it will only ever
                    do one thing. The other great thing about an Arduino is the
                    form factor. The Arduino I am currently developing with as
                    my main processor is the same size as the Arduino I used for
                    the keyboard in the Raspberry Pi prototype: far, far smaller
                    than the Raspberry Pi I used before. Most Arduinos also do
                    not have internet access capabilities anywhere in their
                    hardware, another plus.<br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="content scroll">
                    It isn't all sunshine and rainbows however. Arduinos are
                    weaker in the CPU department, the one I use has a clock
                    speed of 16mhz compared to the 1.4ghz of the Raspberry Pi.
                    This doesn't mean that my Arduino will calculate things as
                    slowly as a TI calculator would, it just means that it is
                    slower than my previous prototype. There is also the issue
                    of memory. The Arduino I use only has 32kb of flash memory.
                    Fitting the same capabilities as my previous calculator onto
                    32kb is going to be tough. Another drawback is that I won't
                    be able to develop software the same way as I did before.
                    There is no such thing as a web browser, HTML, CSS, or even
                    JS in an Arduino; everything that I write will have to be in
                    Arduino's C++ dialect. Development would take a long time,
                    but it isn't the main idea of this next prototype. This
                    prototype is physical: how can I make this calculator
                    exactly what I want from a hardware point of view? Once I
                    prove that I can put a keyboard, battery, screen, and
                    compute unit all in a decent form factor, that is when I
                    will search for funding and create my own MCU with more
                    memory and a faster CPU that fits my form factor exactly.<br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="content scroll">
                    So far in my Arduino journey, I have gotten to the stage
                    where I can input numbers from my keyboard and display them
                    on a display. That seems rudimentary but it really isn't. It
                    took about 2 months to get to this point. I had to get a
                    screen that works with my Arduion, wire it up correctly
                    using its 8-bit parallel interface (no such thing as HDMI in
                    Arduino), find a library that could communicate with an
                    8-bit parallel interface (most display libraries for Arduino
                    are built for a serial interface like SPI), write my own key
                    matrix code (QMK firmware exists to output to USB, something
                    that I don't have on Arduino), and lastly parse all of those
                    individual voltages from the keyboard into numbers to call
                    functions to display stuff on my screen. It is hard to
                    develop something so complex on an Arduino, but it has been
                    fun.<br />
                    I am not going to detail the entire development process thus
                    far as in depth as I did for the Raspberry Pi prototype as I
                    want the 20-20 hindsight when I write about it, and I am
                    still in the midst of developing it.<br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="content scroll">
                    The other piece of the future I want to talk about is in
                    regards to a core change in this project. A couple weeks
                    after my meeting with Dan, I had a meeting with an old
                    advisor named Ben. He teaches math at Issaquah High School
                    and I thought that getting the input of an actual math
                    teacher would be a good idea when it came to making good
                    decisions with this project, after all, they are the ones
                    that will allow or disallow a certain calculator in their
                    classroom, I need to sate them.<br />
                    Ben gave me some valuable insight into how delicate the
                    balancing act of adding features can be. Certain grade
                    levels need to prove that they can actually perform the
                    menial math task (say understanding the general shapes of
                    graphed functions) before they can have the luxury of being
                    able to get the answer quickly from a calculator. This also
                    ties into what I will call the generationality of
                    calculators. The generationality of calculators comes from
                    needing several calculators throughout a student's life.
                    Plenty of students get basic arithmetic once in 5th grade,
                    a scientific calculator once in 6th grade, and a graphing
                    calculator once in 9th grade. That's a lot of calculators,
                    it would be nice to just give a 5th grader a graphing
                    calculator and have them not need the more advanced
                    functionality until they are older. But students cannot be
                    trusted to have that level of power, if you need a middle
                    school student to find the y-intercept of a linear function,
                    you want to make sure that they can do the algebraic work
                    before allowing them to just use the more advanced
                    functionality to calculate the intercept. Ben and I were
                    discussing this when I had the idea of a multi-module
                    calculator: what if students bought one compute unit (with a
                    screen and battery) and as they leveled up their education,
                    they would be allowed to use more different keyboards that
                    enabled greater functionality. Basically, a student's parent
                    buys them a calculator in 5th grade and they also buy the
                    arithmetic keyboard. The compute unit still has the ability
                    to graph functions and do things like matrix multiplication,
                    the student just can't access that functionality without
                    having a keyboard that can send the right input to the
                    compute unit. As the student goes into middle school, high
                    school, or even university, rather than buying a new
                    calculator each time, the student/parent only has to buy
                    another keyboard module. Teachers can verify that a student
                    has the correct module installed with a quick glance and can
                    be assured that the student is doing the mental work where
                    they need to. <br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="content scroll">
                    This has a few benefits: lower cost over a student's
                    lifetime, and less electronic waste. When a student is done
                    needing their basic arithmetic module, it can just be passed
                    on to another student for free or sold on Ebay, further
                    reducing waste. It also would save districts buying in bulk
                    a lot of money: if this hypothetical calculator corporation
                    just needed to manufacture one type of compute module, their
                    manufacturing costs go down and they can pass the savings
                    onto districts.<br />
                    I think this is a fantastic idea, though I am a bit biased,
                    and it wouldn't necessarily be that difficult to develop. I
                    think that more than anything else I will do, this will be
                    the most disruptive to the market.<br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="content scroll">
                    And that is all I have to say. I am hopeful for the future
                    of this project and I hope it makes as much of a splash as I
                    want it to.
