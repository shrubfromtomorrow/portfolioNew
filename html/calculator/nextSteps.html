                    So hopefully you are reading this after having had a look at
                    the rest of the timeline though I wouldn't blame you if you
                    skipped it, it takes a while to read. I wanted to, at the
                    end of all of this, reassert what I am trying to do here.
                    The end goal is to have students that need to take the SAT
                    or the ACT (or any other standardized test for that matter)
                    look on Amazon or in Best Buy and right next to the $150
                    graphing calculators, see a $50 dollar option with as many
                    necessary features and good reviews as all of the big
                    brands. It's a tough task, but even as I head into the next
                    stage of my life with university, it's a challenge I am
                    going to continue to pursue, all because a calculator cost
                    too much. <br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="content scroll">
                    You thought that was a conclusion huh? No, I have a bit more
                    to say.

                    There are a few things that I want to mention regarding the
                    future, some are core aspects of the project, some are just
                    in regards to the physical design of the calculator.<br />
                    The first thing I want to talk about is the next stage of
                    prototyping. <br /><br />

                    The single biggest drawback to my previous prototype is my
                    compute unit. Using a Raspberry Pi is fundamentally against
                    the vision of this project as it is an incredibly open piece
                    of hardware. Not only does it hold a full OS that bad actors
                    could get into, the whole point of something like a Rasperry
                    Pi is that you have control over you hardware, something
                    that would also be a bad idea to give a random student control over.
