                    So to step back and reflect on where I am at in this point
                    in the timeline: I had written the software necessary to
                    perform the arithmetic you would expect of a scientific
                    calculator and the graphing of a normal graphing calculator,
                    I had created the hardware arrangement necessary to create a
                    closed interface between my compute unit and screen, as well
                    as created a keymap and a prototype design of a keyboard for
                    my calculator. Now, I was moving onto a more fleshed out
                    keyboard design.<br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="content scroll">
                    The first thing I wanted to improve over my 3x3 keyboard
                    prototype was the soldering between the keyboard controller
                    and the keyboard. My diode and copper wire solders were
                    pretty decent, but the connections to the GPIO pins of my
                    Arduino were atrocious. I figured that the cleanest way to
                    improve would be to use jumper cables that slide right onto
                    the GPIO headers I had installed. This would also make
                    debugging easier in the event of a misplace wire.<br />
                    I also wanted to scale this up to a 6x4 design, which as you
                    can see in the next image, I did. <br /><br />

                    As you can see here, the soldering is much neater and while
                    the jumper cable connections to the copper are garbage, they
                    are secure. You can also see that the connections into the
                    Arduino are much cleaner. Here I made my first prototype of
                    the keymap I would use for my design exhibition. It was
                    really simple with numbers, arithmetic operators, graph and
                    function input buttons, and some constants. I made sure to
                    leave room for mod buttons that would allow access to other
                    layers and functions. <br />
                    This was also when I realized that the connections I made
                    from the Arduino to the copper rows and columns did not need
                    to be at the ends, they could be anywhere along a row or
                    column. This was incredibly important as it would allow me
                    to cut down on the overall form factor of the keyboard in
                    the final build. <br /><br />

                    This was also the time when I got a special delivery. I had
                    looked around a few weeks earlier on the internet for some
                    low profile keyswitches and keycaps and found that they were
                    a semi-common thing. They arrived and were exactly what I
                    wanted them to be, but before I made a final keyboard with
                    the new switches, I wanted to test another method of wiring
                    to the Arduino that I thought could save some space. <br />

                <div class="scroll" id="keyboards2Cont">
                    <img
                        id="keyboard4"
                        src="../../assets/images/keyboard4.jpg"

                    The wiring may look like an affront to some deity, but it
                    serves to demonstrate an idea that I was toying with. By
                    measuring cables to more specific lengths and cutting down
                    on excess, I could further improve the form factor of the
                    keyboard. As you can see from the second image, the
                    connections take up no more space than the copper wires
                    themselves do. Now, from looking at this, you might think I
                    lied about my discovery that the wires to the Arduino can be
                    connected anywhere along the rows or columns as I connect
                    these wires to the ends still, but that is not the case, I
                    was simply using a flimsier wire (a dissected Cat 5 ethernet
                    cable) and so I wanted to be able to wrap it around the wire
                    for more stability while soldering, something that is hard
                    to do in the middle of the copper wires. <br />

                    And now we come to the final keyboard build. I placed the
                    switches into a switchplate with some keycaps on just to
                    test the general fitting and realized that there was a gap
                    of about 2mm between each switch. That would add up when
                    there were 6 rows and 4 columns. I created a new CAD design
                    of a switchplate to implement the new dimensions and printed
                    it to test the switches.
