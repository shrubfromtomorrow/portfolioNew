                    So, after creating the spiral and its animated counterpart,
                    I decided to take on a new challenge. Up until this point, I
                    had stayed pretty much in the known territory of what you
                    can do with lights like this. Mathematical patterns have
                    been delved deeper into by many other people and there is a
                    whole follow-up video to the video I linked in the
                    introduction that is a livestream that tests a bunch of user
                    submitted code. All of this to say that this was a pretty
                    saturated industry. What I wanted to do was turn the lights
                    into a display. A dumbed-down version of what you are using
                    right now. I had no idea what the code would look like and I
                    only found a few instances of people doing this online.
                </div>

                    There were several problems I needed to tackle to get
                    pixeling to work correctly, least of which was the material
                    the lights were on. However, despite the fact that I only
                    implemented a solution to this after getting some prototype
                    code working, I think that it would be good to start with
                    this. Taking photos of the LEDs is unpredictable at the best
                    of times. The lights could be facing the wrong way, you
                    could be taking all of your photos on a reflective white
                    background (hint hint), or you could have some random object
                    that your lens picks up as perfect white for some reason.
                    Gaussian blur can only take me so far and the smallest error
                    can cost me a whole 10 minutes of my life. For this reason,
                    I decided to make a black background for the lights. I also
                    wanted to create a more crystalline structure for the lights
                    that would grant more consitency on lighting density. For
                    this reason, I took the highly in-depth and precise route of
                    stapling the lights to a board that was painted black.

                    The first picture is the board drying, the second is lights
                    when they were just flung and slightly organised on the
                    board (as well as mapped) and the last picture is of the
                    crystlline lights structure functioning as a laser pointer.
                    The stapling took a while to do and taught me that the
                    electronics were pretty resilient (I stapled straight
                    through the wire 3 times) and were pretty unlikely to
                    malfunction even when an unexpected piece of metal was added
                    to the circuit (staple). <br />
                    I figured out pretty quickly when trying to organise the
                    lights that it was not going to be as easy as I had hoped. I
                    wanted all of the power connectors to be on the same end of
                    the board so that the cable management was easier but this
                    created a lot of difficulty. The lengths of the strings of
                    lights were just not the right length to go the length of
                    the board an interger number of times. For fun (using a
                    program that I will talk about later) I have created
                    visualiser for the way that the lights are lain out. There
                    are switchbacks as well as crosses in a couple places but
                    all in all, I think I acheived a pretty decent density
                    across the board (pun absolutely intended). <br /><br />

                    So with the bit about the board out of the way, I can talk
                    about pixeling. To make something into a display, the first
                    step is to carve out your pixels. With this setup, it might
                    seem logical to use a single light for each pixel, and you
                    would be correct. There is a lack of detail in certain areas
                    on higher resolution images due to the resolution of my
                    board being around 5√6 (12 ish) by 10√6 (24 ish) but at this
                    point, the board's functionality is not as a perfect
                    monitor.<br />
                    The general pixeling process is such: the image is
                    translated into pixel-by-pixel color values and the lights
                    are sort of "overlayed" onto the image. The lights find out
                    what color they are supposed to hold based on the pixel they
                    are sitting on and all of that gets shipped off to a final
                    array of lights and their corresponding colors. If you are
                    playing an animation, the process repeats with each sub
                    array that is full of lights and corresponding colors being
                    added to a massive array that represents the whole
                    animation. <br />
                    The code was somewhat difficult to work out but in the end,
                    it ended up being one of the shortest programs I had written
                    for this project. And most importantly, it works well!
                    Within a certain critera. The lights themselves are not good
                    at displaying brown and they do not have the greatest color
                    accuracy in general. Here are pieces of pixel art I made
                    being displayed on the lights.<br /><br />
