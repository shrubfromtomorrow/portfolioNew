                    I mentioned earlier the idea of describing LEDs in 2
                    dimensions. Here is where I will elborate on that. When you
                    have a normal string of LEDs, they have no concept of their
                    position in space, the LED strips you might put up as
                    decoration are in 1 dimension, there is "in front" and
                    "behind" but the LEDs aren't even smart enough to discern
                    that. A controller at the beginning of the string just sends
                    a bunch of current down the wire and the LEDs scrape off a
                    bit and use that information to power themselves in a
                    certain way. <br />
                    Most of the time, you have no control over the patterns, the
                    manufacturer has created LEDs that understand a specific
                    coded voltage that the controller sends out, and you have
                    very little in the way of methods to control LEDs
                    individually. With special LEDs though (ones with
                    microcontrollers in each LED), you can add a layer of
                    abstraction to the code the LEDs decipher and enable users
                    to control each LED indiviudally programmatically. This
                    allows me to say "light LED 24 with this RGB value". With
                    this, I can make a setup with a camera that takes a photo of
                    each LED, lit indiviudally. <br />
                    With some more code, I can find the brightest pixel of each
                    photo to give each LED a coordinate (x, y pixel value) and
                    make each LED referenceble by its respective coordinate. So
                    now, I can sort the coordinates in x-value order and light
                    the lights up from, say, left to right. The possibilities
                    are near endless and one of the first challenges I decided
                    to take on was the challenge of creating a rotating pattern.

                <div class="content scroll">
                    After a couple of small optimizations, like including the
                    light coordinates as a supplemental text file and being able
                    to execute a certain pattern from a centralised exec file, I
                    moved on to tackle rotation.
                    <br /><br />
                    The goal here was to create some really nice mathematical
                    patterns using rotation. Rotation is a little tough, or at
                    least it is when you don't know what you are doing. It just
                    so happens that in the process of finding an effective
                    method to represent rotation, I derived the 2 dimensional
                    rotation matrix. That looks something like this:

                    Below is the output of the simple test I created to check if
                    my math was correct (I did not know whether my math was
                    correct or not because I had not thought to Google "rotation
                    matrix").
