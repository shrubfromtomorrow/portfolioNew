                    I mentioned earlier the idea of describing LEDs in 2
                    dimensions. Here is where I will elaborate on that. When you
                    have a normal string of LEDs, they have no concept of their
                    position in space, the LED strips you might put up as
                    decoration are in 1 dimension, there is "in front" and
                    "behind" but the LEDs aren't even smart enough to discern
                    that. A controller at the beginning of the string just sends
                    a bunch of current down the wire and the LEDs scrape off a
                    bit and use that information to power themselves in a
                    certain way. <br />
                    Most of the time, you have no control over the patterns, the
                    manufacturer has created LEDs that understand a specific
                    coded voltage that the controller sends out, and you have
                    very little in the way of methods to control LEDs
                    individually. With special LEDs though (ones with
                    microcontrollers in each LED), you can add a layer of
                    abstraction to the code the LEDs decipher and enable users
                    to control each LED individually programmatically. This
                    allows me to say "light LED 24 with this RGB value". With
                    this, I can make a setup with a camera that takes a photo of
                    each LED, lit individually. <br />
                    With some more code, I can find the brightest pixel of each
                    photo to give each LED a coordinate (x, y pixel value) and
                    make each LED referenceable by its respective coordinate. So
                    now, I can sort the coordinates in x-value order and light
                    the lights up from, say, left to right. The possibilities
                    are near endless and one of the first challenges I decided
                    to take on was the challenge of creating a rotating pattern.

                <div class="content scroll">
                    After a couple of small optimizations, like including the
                    light coordinates as a supplemental text file and being able
                    to execute a certain pattern from a centralized exec file, I
                    moved on to tackle rotation.
                    <br /><br />
                    The goal here was to create some really nice mathematical
                    patterns using rotation. Rotation is a little tough, or at
                    least it is when you don't know what you are doing. It just
                    so happens that in the process of finding an effective
                    method to represent rotation, I derived the 2 dimensional
                    rotation matrix. That looks something like this:

                    describing the geometric relation between the lights, and I
                    had some cool patterns. Really all I did in the following
                    weeks was add more lights and create new patterns. Following
                    will be images and videos related to the light setup and the

                    of the videos so far were taken with my laptop camera that
                    gets terribly overexposed and is only 1280x720. The effect
                    can be beneficial for seeing the macro of the light

                    I wanted to stop here to talk about two things, the magic of
                    HSV, and the hardships of rotation.
                    <br />
                    I'll start with the big issue I had with rotation as it ties
                    in with the spiral you see.
                </div>
                <div class="header scroll">Arctan and HSV</div>
                <div class="content scroll">
                    One piece of code I had written involved finding what angle
                    about a circle a point lay on. In order to find that, with
                    the x and y coordinates I had, I needed to use arctan.
                    <br />Using arctan, I would be able to find the radian
                    measure of a point about my origin. This works because where
                    tangent takes in an angle value and will return a ratio
                    between two lengths (though what the lengths are is not
                    explicit), the inverse function of tangent (arctangent)
                    takes in a ratio of side lengths and returns an angle
                    measure. The range of these return values is between œÄ/2 and
                    -œÄ/2 and so using some basic if statements I was able to
                    determine which quadrant of the circle the point lay in and
                    I would add œÄ/2 if it was in the second or third. Arctan is
                    shown below.<br /><br />

                    <br />
                    The issue with this is that the ratio of opposite over
                    adjacent could return undefined. In the situation where the
                    adjacent side, or the x value, is 0, you would have an
                    undefined output. And it just so happens that in my real
                    lighting setup, with my camera of 921,600 pixels and 1280
                    horizontal pixels, I had a light sitting EXACTLY on the y
                    axis (an x value of 0). This was extremely difficult to
                    debug as the error only occurred on the 8th rotation (144
                    degrees) and it was on light 270. This is truly fascinating
                    as the likelihood of a light being on the y-axis at any
                    rotation is 1/1280 or 0.00078. Not to mention that my
                    decimal precision was set to 8, so the value of the adjacent
                    side had to be less than 0.00000000. <br /><br />

                    The whole point of dealing with rotation at all was at the
                    challenge of a friend. After showing them all the things I
                    could do mathematically with the lights, they said I should
                    create a spiral. A spiral came across as pretty daunting but
                    it is actually quite simple.<br /><br />

                    <br />
                    That's it. Using a different constant in front of theta
                    would allow for a bigger or smaller spiral and that is all I
                    needed.
                    <br />
                    With this, I would calculate a certain number of points, say
                    50, that would fit perfectly into a spiral shape. I would
                    then use that code written earlier to figure out which
                    lights were closest to each point and I would light them.
                    Once one spiral was illuminated, I would rotate all of the
                    points using the matrix math above and I would get a new
                    spiral.
                    <br />
                    This feels to me like a dramatic oversimplification, but it
                    really isn't. The principle is quite simple, the execution
                    is another problem. <br /><br />

                    Another issue I faced was on the computation side of using

                    the lights that needed to be lit at this point had been
                    precarious. The first way I did it was by computing all the
                    lights that needed to be on, in order, and then I sent those
                    lights as arguments to the file execution in the command
                    line where they were interpreted on the other side. Bad
                    idea. The main issue with this is that you could only really
                    send one pattern at a time without writing some complex way
                    to parse the light numbers on the raspberry pi side. There
                    is also some character limit in the shell I use that is
                    somewhere around 5000.
                    <br />
                    After realizing I wanted to do this in a more efficient way.
                    I decided to write an execution program that would send a
                    certain file to the raspberry pi, compute all of the lights
                    and their coordinates there, and then light them up. This
                    worked ok. However, as I mentioned before, doing the
                    calculations on the raspberry pi is limited and if you are
                    doing something like, say, calculating all of the points on
                    a spiral of a certain size and doing a bunch of trig to find
                    the closest lights, you would have a long pause between
                    animation frames.
                    <br /><br />
                    The last, and current, method of data transfer comes in the
                    form of precomputation on my computer. Effectively, I do
                    everything I need to, calculation-wise, on my laptop and
                    then I export a "lightOrder.txt" file that contains a list
                    of lists of lights that would need to be turned on at any
                    given time. I then have a second piece of code that parses
                    the lightOrder however I want. For example, I could write
                    that I wanted to sleep the program for 1 second between
                    frames; I would write a sleep function into the parser each
                    time it reads a list of lights. This removes a lot of strain
                    from the raspberry pi and is just a more stable and
                    structured way of actually lighting the lights.<br /><br />

                <div class="content scroll">
                    When I first made the spiral code, I was calculating each
                    frame on the raspberry pi. Given that it had to do at least
                    15,000 trig calculations (50 points, 300 lights to check
                    distance), the frames came out really slowly. This was what
                    pushed me to change the way I sent the data to
                    precalculation with the lightOrder file. However, I wanted
                    it to be faster. The first thing to do here would be to use
                    complex numbers rather than matrix multiplication. Complex
                    numbers are actually so commonly used to represent rotation
                    that the creators of Python made them a built-in function of
                    the language. The way complex numbers work for rotations
                    best visualized with a picture.<br /><br />
                    A complex number is denoted by Z = Ai + B. i is the square
                    root of -1. In our normal number system, no number can be
                    squared and equal -1, it just doesn't work. Thinking of the
                    complex plane as a number line that is perpendicular to our
                    normal number line means that multiplying any number by i
                    will rotate it 90 degrees. If 5 is our starting point,
                    multiplying by i gives 5i. Multiplying by i again give 5i*i
                    and since i is the square root of -1, multiplying i by
                    itself gives -1, and multiplying -1 by 5 give -5. So
                    multiplying by i is equivalent to a 90 degree rotation, but
                    what about a more general formula? Well, this is it:<br /><br />

                    <br />
                    This for Œ∏ being the angle by which you would like to rotate
                    a point. This is only applicable for counterclockwise
                    rotation. This code is faster than the matrix multiplication
                    counterpart as it doesn't need to import another library and
                    it only requires 2 trig functions.<br />
                    Another way to speed this up is by creating a lookup table
                    for rotational values. For example, if I am rotating by 18
                    degrees, I could create a lookup table for all the trig
                    functions I would need to perform. Given that there are only
                    20 distinct angles, this is very feasible.<br />
                    The last method of optimization came from a friend who
                    realized that by changing the spiral's starting point angle,
                    all subsequent angles would be rotated already as the spiral
                    is built off of the last point's position. That code runs
                    way faster and I have added a video of what it looks like.

                    Now, on to the second point I mentioned earlier, this will
                    be more brief. HSV is a color standard, like RGB, but rather
                    than taking 3, 8-bit values to represent different amounts
                    of red, green, and blue, HSV takes a Hue, a Saturation, and
                    a Value. HSV was actually created in the first place for
                    purposes related to computer graphics. My main use of it was
                    as a way to iterate through the traditional rainbow.<br /><br />
                    The traditional rainbow has 7 values, red, orange, yellow,
                    green, blue, indigo, and violet. With RGB, I was unable to
                    find a way to programmatically iterate through certain
                    values of red, green, or blue so as to allow myself to
                    create a rainbow. HSV, on the other hand, has the ability to
                    do this quite easily as the hue value (as in the number, not
                    the V in HSV) is measured in degrees. This would take far
                    too long to explain so I will just add a picture.<br /><br />
                    <div class="imcont">

                    <br />
                    Now, I did not use this very much simply because I didn't
                    need to make a rainbow or use any other method of iterating
                    through hues that much, but it was a cool revelation that it
                    was possible to create a rainbow so easily just by changing
                    the angle around the cylinder. I did create a rainbow with
                    this concept so I will add that.<br /><br />
