                    <br /><br />
                    I found myself in October of 2021, frustrated with the price
                    of a graphing calculator. I needed to buy a graphing
                    calculator for my upcoming ACT and I wanted to get a decent
                    one. I found the average cost for a calculator with a decent
                    resolution for graphing and a color display was around
                    $110.<br /><br />
                    I found myself outraged, and even more so after I got my TI
                    84 Plus CE and found it to be slow and clunky. Buying a
                    graphing calculator is limited. There are only a few
                    reputable brands with only a few halfway decent models worth
                    buying. Ignoring the sponsored links, the results on Amazon
                    for "graphing calculator" consist of 8 Texas Instruments
                    devices and one Casio (at the time of writing).<br /><br />
                    With whole tablets costing $50 dollars to manufacture,
                    surely there is a way to create a calculator that cost very
                    little, is far more powerful than other brands, and is
                    usable on standardized tests. <br />Right?

                    Any good in-depth project has got to start with some
                    research. I started having a look around for root causes in
                    the price of graphing calculators (keep in mind that I
                    didn't know how I wanted to tackle this issue at first).<br/><br/>
