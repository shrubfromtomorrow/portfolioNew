                    This is the capstone project for my senior year at Gibson
                    Ek.
                    <br /><br />
                    I found myself in October of 2021, frustrated with the price
                    of a graphing calculator. I needed to buy a graphing
                    calculator for my upcoming ACT and I wanted to get a decent
                    one. I found the average cost for a calculator with a decent
                    resolution for graphing and a color display was around
                    $110.<br /><br />
                    I found myself outraged, and even more so after I got my TI
                    84 Plus CE and found it to be slow and clunky. Buying a
                    graphing calculator is limited. There are only a few
                    reputable brands with only a few halfway decent models worth
                    buying. Ignoring the sponsored links, the results on Amazon
                    for "graphing calculator" consist of 8 Texas Instruments
                    devices and one Casio (at the time of writing).<br /><br />
                    With whole tablets costing $50 dollars to manufacture,
                    surely there is a way to create a calculator that cost very
                    little, is far more powerful than other brands, and is
                    usable on standardized tests.
                    <br />Right?

                    Any good in-depth project has got to start with some
                    research. I started having a look around for root causes in
                    the price of graphing calculators (keep in mind that I
                    didn't know how I wanted to tackle this issue at first).<br /><br />

                    This article might be old, but it is still relevent. It
                    highlights the massive strides that have been made in
                    technology in the two decades previous and how graphing
                    calculators do not reflect that same leap in technology.<br /><br />
                    The article also talks about how Texas Instruments had (as
                    of 2014) accounted for 93% of all graphing calculator sales,
                    Casio taking the other seven percent up to a useful
                    precision. <br /><br />By far the most important thing to
                    take away from this article is this line: "<strong
                        >“Compared to other electronics this day and age there
                        is very little content,”</strong
                    >
                    said Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis of the TI-84 Plus.
                    <strong
                        >“Plastic case, small black and white screen, two
                        semiconductor chips. The batteries are even not
                        rechargeable like a cell phone.”</strong
                    >
                    He estimates a TI-84 Plus costs <strong>$15-20</strong> to
                    manufacture and has a profit margin of over
                    <strong>50</strong> percent for Texas Instruments."<br /><br />
                    This article goes much further in depth than I wish to here
                    and I recommend reading it to gain an idea of the
                    frustration I feel over this topic.
